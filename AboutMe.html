<p class="aboutme"> About Me</p>
<h5>My name is Alexis Chavarria. I was born and raised in Belize City. At St. John's College Junior College, I'm pursuing an associate's degree in Management Information Systems (second year). Painting, sketching, and computing have always been some of my favourite hobbies. I was always someone who was acutely aware of my surroundings as I grew up. Nowadays, I find that many individuals in my country are unconcerned with their mental health. As a result, I created a website to assist raise mental health awareness. Many people are unsure of how to keep their mental health in check.</h5>
